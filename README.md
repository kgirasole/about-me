# about-me

I am a Computer and Information Sciences graduate from the United States.

I really like the creative side of software developing, from developing interactive applications to good user experiences. I love working on ground-up type projects, where I really get to be on the frontlines. I love to learn in general. On top of that, I'm a casual gamer, guitarist, music lover and gym-goer. 

I have experience developing applications with Angular, JavaScript, C# and PHP, with proficiencies in other languages as well, like Python and JavaScript.

I am currently working as a Web Developer making high quality, user friendly web pages using JavaScript and .NET.


Thanks for checking me out! :)
